# Predicting-Bird-Strikes
This repository contains the final project for Applied Machine Learning, where we built and evaluated predictive models to assess the risk of bird strikes on aircraft. The project explores various machine learning techniques to classify incidents and determine whether they resulted in aircraft damage.
